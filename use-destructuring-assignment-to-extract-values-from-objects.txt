//Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

//Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

//solution

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// change code below this line
const {today, yesterday} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
const {tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
// change code above this line

console.log(yesterday) // should be not defined
console.log(today); // should be 77
console.log(tomorrow); // should be 80
